		<h1 id="home">7th International IP workshop</h1>
		<p>We are happy to announce that the <b>7th International IP workshop will take place between 28th - 30th May 2024 in the heart of Lund, Sweden.</b><br>Please save the dates!</p>
		<img src="src/images/lund-univ2.jpg" alt="Lund University Building" class="image-lund">
		<p>Lund is well connected to the European train system. The nearest well-connected international airport is Copenhagen/Denmark, and there are a limited number of international flights to Malmö Airport.</p>
		<p>Since Lund is usually very populated with tourist by this time of the year, we strongly recommend an early booking of the hotel. A list of hotels <a href="https://visitlund.se/en/accommodation-and-travel/stay-in-lund" target=”_blank”>can be found here</a>.</p>
		<p>More information will be sent out in autumn of this year. We are looking forward to welcoming all of you in Sweden next year</p>

		<!-- PROGRAM -->
		<h2 id="program">Program</h2>
		<p>There will be 4 session help during the conference and 1 general session. The discussions will be focused around the sessions. A first version of the program will be available in April.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>IP for mineral exploration</h3>
		<p>The workshop session addresses the diverse aspects of measuring and modelling IP responses of metallic particles and ores across the scales. We invite contributions focused on both primary and secondary mineral resources, including mine tailings, urban waste, and slags, as well as artificial samples. The session also aims at exploring the connections between IP parameters and petrophysical properties utilizing both empirical and mechanistic models.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Tackling measurement ambiguity: Towards a more reliable interpretation of recorded IP signals</h3>
		<p>Understanding the source of the IP signal in the field is challenging yet necessary if the IP method shall be used to provide meaningful interpretation of subsurface properties and processes. While time-lapse approaches allow subtracting the influence of time-invariant properties, they are often applied to dynamic environments, where changes may be subtle, overlapping each other and ambiguity remains between different processes that can be responsible for a similar response. Current challenges include (i) limited understanding of the validity of various petrophysical relations at different scales, (ii) lack of quantitative relations between the time-domain IP response and properties or processes of interest and (iii) lack of integrative modelling tools allowing to quantitatively test different hypotheses. Field-, modelling- and lab-based approaches that help constrain the interpretation of field IP data are the primary scope of this session. Contributions focusing on coupled models, joint inversion as well as joint interpretation between e.g. reactive transport predictions and IP monitoring, upscaling petrophysical relations to Darcy scale or field scale, disentangling between different sources of the recorded IP signal and addressing uncertainties and their quantification are particularly welcome.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Contaminated soil and monitoring of dynamic processes </h3>
		<p>The goal is to share knowledge, experiences, and innovative approaches in applying IP for characterization of contaminated soil and monitoring of dynamic processes. Furthermore, the session aims to foster a collaborative environment and discuss further opportunities for new applications of IP, enhancing our ability to monitor and understand complex systems. Investigating the physical processes that can be monitored using Induced Polarization (IP) is crucial for extending its application. The integration of IP with various forms of data is not merely an enhancement but a necessity in grappling with the complexities of geological, environmental, and engineering challenges. Identifying the complimentary data needed alongside IP is essential for enhancing the accuracy and scope of these efforts. We welcome contributions on the topics of characterization and monitoring of contamination, remediation treatments, leachates and mine-tailings. We will also consider contributions that use IP for monitoring other dynamic processes.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>From field data acquisition and processing to inversion</h3>
		<p>Instrument properties and acquisition procedures set the limits for the information content of IP field data. Data processing can enhance the recorded data by filtering out various types of noise, within limits set by the data acquisition. Data inversion is then needed to extract geomaterial properties, where estimating the geophysical properties in themselves is generally not the primary goal but may be used as a proxy. Alternatively, it is possible to invert directly for the desired properties as for instance permeability. The signal-to-noise ratio and contamination of the IP signals by undesirable sources limits what information can be extracted from field data. For example, EM coupling can be a problem that might be addressed by minimising it, by removing it in the signal processing or by including it in the inversion process. The session addresses the opportunities and challenges around enhancing the information that can be extracted from IP field data, covering the entire workflow from acquisition to inversion and new developments in machine learning. We welcome contributions to the fields of instrument developments, data processing algorithms and inversion approaches in a broad perspective, both methodologically and application focused.</p>
